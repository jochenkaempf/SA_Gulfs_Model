# SA_Gulfs_Model
This model was used for a scientific manuscript entitled: “How tides significantly alter the flushing of two large alongside inverse estuaries” (author Jochen Kämpf) submitted to Geophysical Research Letters in May 2025. 

The model code is based on the original version of the COHERENS model (Luyten eta al, 1999). The model's user guide is available here: https://uol.de/f/5/inst/icbm/ag/physoz/download/from_emil/COHERENS/print/userguide.pdf. (Accessed 21 May 2025)
The mode code can be run on Windows computers using the GFORTRAN compiler with the runModel Windows batch file.

One model code (found in the folder WithTides) includes tidal effects. The other code (located in the folder WithoutTides) does not include tides. GIF animations of the simulations are available in the Animation subfolders as a bonus.
